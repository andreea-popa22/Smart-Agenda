3. A consumer should be able to edit an appointment in case of an emergency.
4. A consumer/provider should be able to delete an appointment which they belong.
5. A consumer/provider should be able to filter appointments by different criteria: date, client, provider.
6. A consumer should be able to view all the services available.
7. A consumer should be informed about the location of an appointment.
8. A provider should be able to add new services in the application.
9. A provider should be able to select the company they are working for.
